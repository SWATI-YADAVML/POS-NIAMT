## POS Tagging Project 📝

This project is a Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging application developed using Python. POS tagging is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that labels each word in a sentence with its grammatical category, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.

## 💡 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to demonstrate how POS tagging can be applied using supervised machine learning or rule-based approaches. It can be used for various NLP tasks like syntactic analysis, machine translation, and information retrieval.

## 🚀 Features

- Tokenizes user input text
- Tags each word with its part of speech
- Displays tagged output in an easy-to-read format
- GUI support using tkinter (optional)
- File upload support for batch POS tagging (optional)
- Custom model or library-based tagging (e.g., NLTK or spaCy)
